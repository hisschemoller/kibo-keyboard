# Kibo Keyboard

Demo: https://hisschemoller.github.io/kibo-keyboard/

Kibo Keyboard is a simple melodic music keyboard online app. Each time you play a note a small ball appears on screen that bounces around. Each time it bounces off another object it repeats its sound. This way the balls create an irregular echo delay effect.

The harder you play the note (MIDI velocity) the higher the octave of the sound.

## Kodaly Kibo

This app is especially made to work with the [Kodaly Kibo](https://www.kodaly.app/). Therefore it only listens to the eight MIDI note pitches the Kibo controller generates: 60, 62, 64, 65, 67, 69, 71 and 72.
